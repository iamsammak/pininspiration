Error Log {
1:
  Inside package.json
    Error: Cannot read config file:
    /Users/samuelmak/Desktop/kammas/fullstackproject/Pinspiration/package.json
    Error: Cannot read config file: /Users/samuelmak/Desktop/kammas/fullstackproject/Pinspiration/package.json
    Error: Unexpected token }

  * I had an extra "," *
  Which didn't allow me to run webpack or anything else

2.
  Ran into an infinite loop between "/" replacing "/login"
  I had both ensureLoggedIn and redirectIfLoggedIn but replaceing the url path if a currentUser exists
  forgot a ! before currentUser in my ensureLoggedIn function

3.
  error: Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.
  I forgot to export default withRouter(Nav) so it was saying connect(Component) was undefined or null
4.
  Forgot to add :user in the board index / pin index
5.

6. Pin count error (user.jsx)
  probably related to error 5
  but in user set pin count to this.props.pin.pin.length
  and upon every scroll it re-fetches for pins which then duplicates the amount of pins
  therefore increasing the pin count
  not true pin count
}


CSS Error log {
1: for background image url - the "images" folder will be skipped when you write your path
  ex)   background-image: url('/assets/rainbow.jpg');
  take-away: with image url path, start at the root "/" then go into assets folder
2: background: rgba(255, 255, 153, 0.5);
  rgb color and opacity
  css opacity only to background color not the text on it
}
