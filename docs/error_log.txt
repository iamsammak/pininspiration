TODO Thursday
1. squarespace logos plus updating splash page
5. implement a new font, so I can bold certain areas i.e. username
2. catalog
COMPLETE - 3. masonary the following/followers (flex wrapped them)
4. fix pin/board edit and delete rerendering state


if you don't end up getting to the catalog icon, then disable it
- if I change the catalog icon to another search icon that when clicked upon will drop down the list of boards

Idea 1
- either have a dropdown or a modal appear with links to all the boards available
Idea 2
- has a link to three predefined boards
- and a random option that will random pick a number between the Board.count
- then appead that number to the board url path


TODO Friday
1. favicon
2. production readme
3. Last minute css styling
4. update seed data - add more text to the board descriptions
5. Keep dyno awake
6. get rid of minify warning in heroku (check slack)

Error Log {
1:
  Inside package.json
    Error: Cannot read config file:
    /Users/samuelmak/Desktop/kammas/fullstackproject/Pinspiration/package.json
    Error: Cannot read config file: /Users/samuelmak/Desktop/kammas/fullstackproject/Pinspiration/package.json
    Error: Unexpected token }

  * I had an extra "," *
  Which didn't allow me to run webpack or anything else

2.
  Ran into an infinite loop between "/" replacing "/login"
  I had both ensureLoggedIn and redirectIfLoggedIn but replaceing the url path if a currentUser exists
  forgot a ! before currentUser in my ensureLoggedIn function

3.
  error: Uncaught Error: Invariant Violation: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: object.
  I forgot to export default withRouter(Nav) so it was saying connect(Component) was undefined or null
4.
  Forgot to add :user in the board index / pin index
5.
warning.js:37 Warning: flattenChildren(...): Encountered two children with the same key, `1Our ends are our beginnings`. Child keys must be unique; when two children share a key, only the first child will be used.

6. Pin count error (user.jsx)
  probably related to error 5
  but in user set pin count to this.props.pin.pin.length
  and upon every scroll it re-fetches for pins which then duplicates the amount of pins
  therefore increasing the pin count
  not true pin count
  Fixed it by changing pin count to this.props.user.pins.length
  because you can only create a pin for a board you own


7. Delete Board wasn't working
  I was passing the board as payload in board_actions instead of the id
  which is what the middleware was listening for
  - I also spelled "destroy" as "destory" in the routes.rb file which caused the 404 error upon DELETE

8. Heroku push not working
  reason is because I didn't npm install --save some of the libraries
  on installed them, which I guess is temporary?

9. 401 in heroku, auth issue

10. error in refresh router
  error refresh route error
  if there is an uncaught error, all lifecycle methods get dropped
  error because this.user was undefined (which makes sense upon component mounting)
  fixed by adding - returning an empty div upload component mount if user is undefined
  if(!this.user) {
    return (<div></div>);
  }

11. In user profile router
  the deleteboard wasn't working, or well it was but I needed to rerender the profile show page
  which means refetching all Boards
  so I added "fetchBoards" into the props of boards.jsx where I call board_item
  which then gave me access to fetchBoards in my props
  so I just called this.fetchBoards(userId) inside my handleDeleteBoardSubmit

CSS Error log {
1: for background image url - the "images" folder will be skipped when you write your path
  ex)   background-image: url('/assets/rainbow.jpg');
  take-away: with image url path, start at the root "/" then go into assets folder
2: background: rgba(255, 255, 153, 0.5);
  rgb color and opacity
  css opacity only to background color not the text on it
}
